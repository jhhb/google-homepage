This project is a "clone" of the google homepage.

The only differences are some font / spacing / hexcolor differences.

One difference which I could / should improve upon is the spacing of the elements inside the header div; I had some trouble spacing / formatting the images and text exactly the way I wanted. I will try to fix this.

Kind of sloppy right now but no big deal.
